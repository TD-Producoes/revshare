Onboarding is where a lot of marketplace products win or lose users — especially **two-sided** ones like RevShare.

Below is a **clear, role-aware onboarding flow** that:

- minimizes friction
- teaches the mental model early
- gets users to a “first win” fast
- doesn’t overwhelm with setup too early

I’ll split it into:

1. Shared principles
2. Creator (merchant) onboarding steps
3. Marketer onboarding steps
4. What to delay (very important)

---

## 0️⃣ Core onboarding principles (anchor these)

Before steps, lock these rules:

1. **Role first**
   The very first thing the user chooses is:

   > “I’m a creator” or “I’m a marketer”

2. **Progressive disclosure**
   Do NOT ask for:

   - Stripe
   - RevenueCat
   - payout details
     until the user _understands why_

3. **First win < 5 minutes**

   - Creator: publish a project (even draft)
   - Marketer: apply to or save a project

4. **Explain before you ask**
   Every “technical” step needs a _why_ sentence.

---

## 1️⃣ Step 0 (shared): Role selection

### Screen

**What brings you to RevShare?**

Buttons:

- 🏗️ **I’m a Creator** (I want marketers to promote my product)
- 📣 **I’m a Marketer** (I want to promote products)

Small copy:

> You can switch roles later.

This decision personalizes _everything_ that follows.

---

# 🧑‍💻 Creator (Merchant) Onboarding

### Goal

Get them to:

> “I published a program and understand how commissions + payouts work.”

---

## Creator Step 1 — Project basics (fast, non-technical)

**Screen**

> Create your first project

Fields:

- Project name
- Website / app URL
- Business type:

  - SaaS
  - Shopify / Ecommerce
  - Mobile app

- Public or private (default: Public)

Why this works:

- No Stripe
- No RevenueCat
- No fear yet

CTA:
**Continue**

---

## Creator Step 2 — Commission & rules (core value)

**Screen**

> Define your revenue-share terms

Fields:

- Commission percentage (e.g. 20%)
- Refund window (e.g. 30 days)

Inline explanation:

> Commissions unlock only after the refund window ends. This protects you from chargebacks.

Optional (collapsed):

- Allow performance rewards (toggle)

CTA:
**Preview program**

This step teaches the _RevShare philosophy_.

---

## Creator Step 3 — Publish & discovery

**Screen**

> Make your program discoverable

Options:

- ✔ List in public directory
- ✔ Show revenue stats publicly (optional)
- ✔ Accept applications automatically or manually

Short reassurance:

> You’re always in control. You can pause or edit anytime.

CTA:
**Publish project**

🎉 First win achieved.

---

## Creator Step 4 — Connect revenue source (can be skippable)

**Screen**

> Connect your revenue source

Options:

- Connect Stripe
- Connect RevenueCat
- Skip for now

Copy:

> You can connect later, but revenue tracking is required to pay commissions.

This step should be:

- skippable
- clearly explained
- not blocking exploration

---

## Creator Step 5 — Payout setup (later, contextual)

Only prompt this when:

- commissions exist
- or before first payout

> “Before paying marketers, connect your Stripe account.”

---

# 📣 Marketer Onboarding

### Goal

Get them to:

> “I found programs worth promoting and understand how earnings work.”

---

## Marketer Step 1 — Profile basics

**Screen**

> Create your marketer profile

Fields:

- Display name
- Country
- Promotion type:

  - Content
  - Ads
  - Email
  - Social

- Public profile: on/off (default: on)

Why:

- Enables discovery
- Sets expectations for creators

CTA:
**Continue**

---

## Marketer Step 2 — Discover programs (this is the hook)

**Screen**

> Find programs to promote

Show:

- Public project directory
- Filters: commission, category, revenue
- “Trending” / “New” sections

Encourage:

- Save a project
- Apply to a project

CTA:
**Apply to a program** or **Save & continue**

🎉 First win.

---

## Marketer Step 3 — Attribution explained (education)

**Screen**

> How you earn commissions

Explain visually:

```
Your link / coupon → customer → revenue → commission → payout
```

Key points:

- First-touch attribution (or your chosen rule)
- Refund windows
- When earnings become available

This builds trust early.

CTA:
**Got it**

---

## Marketer Step 4 — Payout setup (delay this!)

Do NOT force Stripe immediately.

Trigger this when:

- earnings > $0
- or marketer clicks “Earnings”

Screen:

> Get paid via Stripe

Copy:

> Connect once. Get paid for all programs.

---

# 4️⃣ What to deliberately delay or hide

This is critical.

### 🚫 Do NOT ask early for:

- Stripe Connect
- Bank account
- RevenueCat API keys
- Webhooks
- Tax info

Early onboarding should feel:

> “light, reversible, safe”

---

## 5️⃣ Onboarding checklist (UX pattern)

Show a checklist in dashboard after onboarding:

### Creator checklist

- ✔ Create project
- ⏳ Connect revenue source
- ⏳ Review first application
- ⏳ Set up payouts

### Marketer checklist

- ✔ Create profile
- ✔ Apply to first program
- ⏳ Share first link
- ⏳ Connect payout method

This keeps users moving without modal fatigue.

---

## 6️⃣ One sentence to guide all onboarding UX

> **Onboarding should explain the rules of the game before asking users to play.**

You’re building a _financial marketplace_ — clarity beats speed.

---

If you want next, I can:

- design **exact onboarding screens & copy**
- define **when to branch Stripe vs RevenueCat**
- help you build **tooltips vs full screens**
- or design **onboarding analytics** (drop-off points)

Just tell me which one to do next.
