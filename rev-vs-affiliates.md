# RevShare vs Traditional Affiliate Networks

## A better way to build revenue-share partnerships

Traditional affiliate networks were built for links and cookies.
RevShare is built for **real revenue, transparency, and long-term partnerships** — especially for SaaS, subscriptions, and modern online businesses.

If you’ve used affiliate networks before, here’s how RevShare is different.

## Why traditional affiliate networks fall short

Affiliate networks like AWIN, CJ, ClickBank, Rakuten, Impact, and PartnerStack work well for broad discovery — but they come with limitations:

* Revenue is tracked indirectly (cookies, clicks)
* Refunds and chargebacks often appear later as “adjustments”
* Subscription revenue is hard to follow over time
* Program quality and performance data is opaque
* Marketers often don’t know *why* payouts change

RevShare was designed to solve these problems.

| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |

| **Marketplace transparency**       | Public projects & marketer directories           | Limited visibility into performance |
| **Commission visibility**          | Full breakdown: earned, pending, available       | Often aggregated or delayed         |

## What makes RevShare different

### Revenue-first, not click-first

RevShare tracks **actual revenue generated**, not just clicks or last-touch attribution.
Commissions unlock only after the refund window ends — protecting both creators and marketers.

---

### Transparent by default

Marketers can see:

* how much revenue they generated
* what’s pending vs available
* why adjustments happened
* when payouts are scheduled

No surprises. No silent deductions.

---

### Built for modern businesses

RevShare is designed for:

* SaaS products
* subscription businesses
* Shopify stores
* apps with recurring revenue

Not just one-time purchases.

---

### Public discovery

Instead of hidden programs behind network logins:

* Projects can be publicly discoverable
* Marketers can showcase performance
* Both sides can find better partnerships faster

This creates a real marketplace — not just a backend tool.

---

### Performance rewards, not just commissions

Creators can offer milestone-based rewards when marketers hit revenue or sales goals:

* free subscriptions
* upgrades
* perks or access

A long-term incentive model most affiliate networks don’t support.

---

## When affiliate networks still make sense

Affiliate networks are useful if you want:

* massive brand catalogs
* coupon aggregation
* broad consumer offers

RevShare is ideal when you want:

* serious partnerships
* predictable revenue share
* transparency on earnings
* subscription-friendly tracking

Many teams even use **both** — networks for reach, RevShare for core partnerships.

---

## Built on trust, not black boxes

RevShare is built with:

* clear rules
* visible metrics
* refund-aware logic
* Stripe-powered payments

So everyone understands how money moves — before it moves.
