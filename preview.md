This is a **very common (and solvable) pre-launch problem**, especially for marketplaces. The key is to **never let an empty state look like a failure**. Instead, it should look **intentional, informative, and aspirational**.

Below is a **clear, battle-tested approach** you can implement without fake data.

---

# The core principle (anchor this)

> **Pre-launch pages should demonstrate the value of the marketplace, not its current size.**

So:

* ❌ Don’t hide Projects / Marketers
* ❌ Don’t show empty tables without explanation
* ❌ Don’t fake numbers

Instead:

* ✅ Use **guided empty states**
* ✅ Use **example content**
* ✅ Convert exploration into waitlist signups

---

# Option A (recommended): “Preview mode” directories

Treat **Projects** and **Marketers** as **preview / coming-soon marketplaces**.

### Top banner (very important)

On both directories, add a clear but friendly banner:

> 🚧 **Marketplace Preview**
> RevShare is launching soon. Explore example programs and see how discovery will work.

This immediately reframes expectations.

---

## Projects Directory (pre-launch)

### What to show

Instead of “no projects”, show:

### 1️⃣ Example projects (clearly labeled)

Use **3–6 example cards**, marked as:

> *Example program*

Examples:

* “Acme SaaS” – 20% commission – Subscription
* “Creator Tools” – 25% commission – SaaS
* “Shopify Store” – 15% commission – Ecommerce

Important:

* Do NOT show fake revenue numbers
* Use placeholders like:

  * “Revenue: shown after launch”
  * “Applicants: launching soon”

This demonstrates:

* how cards look
* how filters work
* what marketers will be able to compare

---

### 2️⃣ Filters still work (even on examples)

Let users:

* filter by commission %
* category
* pricing model

This shows **capability**, not scale.

---

### 3️⃣ Primary CTA (conversion-focused)

On every example card:

**CTA**

> Join the waitlist to apply

Click → waitlist signup modal.

---

## Marketers Directory (pre-launch)

### What to show

Instead of empty profiles:

### 1️⃣ “How marketer profiles will look”

Show **2–3 example profiles**, clearly labeled:

> *Example marketer profile*

Include:

* Promotion type (Content / Ads)
* Industries
* “Public profile” badge
* “Performance stats visible after launch”

This helps creators understand:

> “This is who I’ll be working with.”

---

### 2️⃣ CTA for creators

Banner or side panel:

> Want marketers to find you on launch day?
> **Join the creator waitlist**

---

# Option B: Gate directories behind intent (lighter)

If you want even less surface area:

* Projects / Marketers still appear in nav
* Clicking them shows:

  * short explanation
  * preview screenshots
  * waitlist CTA

This is simpler, but less powerful than Option A.

---

# Option C: Role-aware empty states (best UX)

Detect intent:

### If user clicks **Projects**

Assume marketer intent.

Show:

> “Marketers will be able to discover public programs here.”

CTA:

* Join marketer waitlist

---

### If user clicks **Marketers**

Assume creator intent.

Show:

> “Creators will discover verified marketers here.”

CTA:

* Join creator waitlist

This makes the emptiness feel **personalized**, not broken.

---

# Navigation handling (important)

### Keep nav items visible

Do **not** remove:

* Projects
* Marketers

Removing them weakens your marketplace positioning.

### But…

Add subtle labels in nav:

* Projects *(Preview)*
* Marketers *(Preview)*

This sets expectations before the click.

---

# Copy you can reuse (plug & play)

### Global empty state copy

> RevShare is launching soon.
> We’re onboarding creators and marketers right now.

### CTA copy (marketers)

> Join the waitlist to be first to apply to programs.

### CTA copy (creators)

> Join the waitlist to publish your program at launch.

---

# What NOT to do (important)

❌ Don’t fake revenue numbers
❌ Don’t show “0 projects found” without explanation
❌ Don’t hide marketplace navigation
❌ Don’t over-explain “we’re early”

Early is fine — **empty without context is not**.

---

# Bonus: turn emptiness into urgency

Add a small counter:

> **Launching with the first 50 creators and 200 marketers**

Even if it’s aspirational, it signals momentum.

---

# Recommended final setup (clear)

**Nav**

* Product
* Solutions
* Projects *(Preview)*
* Marketers *(Preview)*

**Directories**

* Example cards
* Clear “Preview” banner
* Strong waitlist CTA

This makes your landing page feel:

* intentional
* confident
* early but serious
