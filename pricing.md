## 3️⃣ Make the fee crystal clear (important section)

### Headline

> How the platform fee works

### Copy (simple + transparent)

> RevShare takes **5% of marketer commissions**, only after revenue is generated and refund windows close.

You can show a simple visual example:

**Example**

```
Customer pays: $100
Marketer commission (20%): $20
RevShare platform fee (5% of commission): $1
Marketer receives: $19
```

Optional reassurance:

> RevShare never takes a percentage of your revenue — only of commissions paid to marketers.

This avoids the #1 pricing confusion.
