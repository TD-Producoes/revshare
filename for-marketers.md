Great choice starting with **“For Marketers”** — this page can convert *very* well if you lean into **discovery, trust, and predictability**.

Below is a **full page plan with concrete copy**, section by section, plus guidance on **where to place screenshots / visuals** and what kind of images work best.

I’ll write this as **near-production copy** (you can tweak tone later).

### Goal of the hero

Answer in 5 seconds:

* *What is this?*
* *Why should I care?*
* *Why is it better than other affiliate programs?*

### Secondary CTA

**Create a marketer profile**

---

### Supporting trust bullets (very important)

## One copy principle to follow everywhere

Avoid hype words like:

* “AI-powered”
* “10x growth”
* “viral”

Use:

* revenue
* transparency
* predictable
* visible
* auditable

That’s what serious marketers respond to.

If you want next, I can:

* write the **For Creators** page with the same depth
* select **exact dashboard screenshots** and where to place them
* help you define **what data appears publicly** vs logged-in
* tighten this copy for a **shorter / punchier version**

Just tell me what you want to do next.
